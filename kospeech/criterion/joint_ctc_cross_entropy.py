    Label smoothed cross entropy loss function.

    Args:
        num_classes (int): the number of classfication
        ignore_index (int): Indexes that are ignored when calculating loss
        dim (int): dimension of calculation loss
        reduction (str): reduction method [sum, mean] (default: sum)
        ctc_weight (float): weight of ctc loss
        cross_entropy_weight (float): weight of cross entropy loss

    Inputs: logit, target
        logit (torch.Tensor): probability distribution value from model and it has a logarithm shape
        target (torch.Tensor): ground-thruth encoded to integers which directly point a word in label

    Returns: label_smoothed
        - **label_smoothed** (Tensor): sum of loss
